        <h1>EQ</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>whats this emotional quotient nonsense?!</h2>
            <p>it is generally defined as being highly conscious of ones own emotional states (having the ability to identify and manage them) and also the emotional states of others.
                having emotional intelligence, or an ability to read, understand and communicate with others is a vital, trainable skill needed to navigate that complexities of human interaction and existence. its also essential for relating to oneself as a complex human with a rich and diverse internal world that is reflective of ones experience, especially formed in early life. the way we interact with the world, with others, the way we react, understand and perceive the world is through these subjective minds with their unique histories, so an understanding of their inner workings would seem to be indispensable for leading a conscious, beneficial, happy life. </p>

            <h2>IQ and EQ</h2>
            <p>IQ (intelligence quotient) is a standardised test used to evaluate intelligence as defined by a 100+ year old lineage of white cis men. though the test has had many revisions, IQ assesses verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory and processing speed, whereas EQ, in general measures: perceiving emotions, regulating emotions, and utilising emotions. until recently (and certainly still in much of society), IQ was generally thought to be the defining measure of intelligence- a result in part of colonial white supremacy in western science. IQ has been (and in some places in the world, still being) used as a tool by violent ideologies to oppress non-white racial groups. the emergence of the concept (by white science) of emotional intelligence was in part a recognition of the limitations of IQ and the presence of a more diverse range to overall intelligence (according to those who define it and its method of defining).

            <h2>the necessity of EQ</h2>
            <p>it is important because people are important. we are important, and just as we are, so too is everyone else. everything that keeps us alive- food, clothing, a house, money, a job, the roads we walk on- all come from other people. their labour and kindness keeps us alive and so being able to interact with others well can also be seen as a basis of our own wellbeing, due to this inter-connectedness. so too are we complex. humans have complex minds and psychologies and this all needs to be navigated when we interact with each other.

                nothing we do can be achieved within a vacuum of just ourselves, thinking about true independence in these terms is just an illusion. therefore we need to act in cooperation with others, to get things done, to navigate our personal and private lives; to be happy. and as the experience of others is deeply affecting to us, our happiness is also linked to theirs.
                
                An ability to read, understand and communicate with others is a vital skill because of our interdependence. working together in any situation takes emotional labour and if people’s EQ’s are significantly imbalanced in a group, someone (usually a woman) will end up being lumped with an enormous amount of this invisible labour that is essential to achieving a very visible, tangible task.</p>
