  <h1>GOODBYE FOUNDATIONS</h1>
  <div>
      <h2>part1</h2>
      <h3>learnings</h3>
      <p>
        rather than learning new things about myself, i would more accurately describe it as a deeper learning of myself. none of the core learning was unfamiliar to me as i have grown up steeped in an introspective tradition of learning but because i work with an analytical psychologist and am always thinking in this vein, the experiences during foundations have given me more to work with in terms of my own self and the origins/ habits of my mind. 
      </p>
      <h3>role of values, empathy and self awareness in programming</h3>
      <p>
        a person without self awareness can be destructive and harmful to others, regardless of intent. in all aspects of life, it is difficult to be around someone with a lack of self awareness- hence, working in a team as a programmer, one needs this quality for the success and well being of not just oneself but for everyone you are directly/indirectly associated with. 
        <br>
        empathy…that practice is debatable, i prefer compassion as empathy can be draining, especially for minorities and a contributor to burnout. compassion is more active as a practice and gives rather than takes energy, whilst retaining all of the aspects of goodness. without compassion, learning and working is contextless. our lives are built up upon the work and kindness of others and if our own actions of body speech and mind do not reflect this, we are not acting in accordance with reality. the reality of our interdependence with others. so much harm can be caused to oneself and others when a person is lacking a compassionate attitude. luckily, its entirely trainable. 
        <br>
        values seems to almost come from the presence of self awareness and compassion. if values stem from these qualities, they can work for the wellbeing of the community and the person. without these qualities to guide our work and learning, we can create and engage in practices and develop tools that can cause great harm or reproduce hidden biases in our own minds that we then regurgitate out into the world out of our own places of privilege and ignorance. it seems purposeless to live in this way. the more awake we are about ourselves and the world, the more we can engage in a constructive way the serves others and therefore also ourselves. 
        <br>
        the best examples of this in the programming world are the reproduction of racism and sexism through algorithmic bias (read ‘Artificial unintelligence’ by Meredith Broussard, watch ‘Coded Bias’ documentary, follow ‘algorithmic justice league’ on instagram). without self awareness and compassion, we might very well enter the work force only to contribute unknowingly to the invisible oppression and suffering of others. 
      </p>
      <h3>why is the core important at EDA</h3>
      <p>
        i think it’s vital for any institution of education to act and educate responsibly the individuals who go through them. our society is made up of the collective learning we do and if there are vital parts of learning not present, this has negative effects on society. churning out technical experts with no self awareness, compassion or values is a terrifying reality, and its consequences on the world and for others is very real. if we want to reduce harm and increase benefit for the individual all the way out to society, these skills and practices are non negotiable.

      <h3>career-ing ambitions</h3>
      <p>
        im keen to get a job. to be in one place and learn and grow and gain all of the benefits from being still, after having travelled and lived/worked overseas for most of my adult life. so in that way the mere fact of having a stable job will be very satisfying. i would of course love/need this job to involve something meaningful. i think i would find it difficult to work on something that didn’t apply to a wider context that matched with my values. it would be wonderful to work for a an organisation of some kind that is of benefit to the community and in that way i too could contribute to the wellbeing of others through my work. 
      </p>
      <h3>helpers and hinderers of le mind</h3>
      <p>
        that my mind loves to learn is something that im very grateful for and know will help make the bootcamp enjoyable. i have to have a keen eye fixed on the part of me that wants to throw its hands up in the air at a problem and tend towards panic when the solution doesn’t reveal itself easily. luckily i have well developed grit that will pull me back to the problem and a stubborn streak that won’t let it best me!
      </p>
      <h3>bootcamp challenges and commitments</h3>
      <p>
        managing my exhaustion and stress is something im quite good at, however the presence of exhaustion and stress in my body is very challenging and something i will need to closely watch over during bootcamp. 
        hence i commit to the discipline of early nights, vegan whole foods, daily meditation and regular exercise! also to reaching out when i need help to friends or the facilitators and being as gentle with myself as possible throughout the next 9 weeks. 
      </p>
      <h3>desired non-technical skills</h3>
      <p>
        discipline. 100%. something that is really challenging for me that ive had a much deeper learning of in the last 5 weeks is that sitting with the micro process, the ambiguity, the persevering at the unsexy problem, the lack of glory involved- thats a SUPER challenge for my mind. to keep at the thing that just doesn’t seem to have a solution, feeling like i cant do it, and knowing this will not be over anytime soon- i am both terrified and very grateful at the prospect of being in a place where this will be my bread and butter. im looking forward to being able to better hold myself kindly with a problem, develop the skills to solve problems and practice all of the beautiful qualities that are involved in that process such as perseverance, patience, open mindedness, discipline and awareness. because these can then be applied to the rest of my life and how wonderful is that!
