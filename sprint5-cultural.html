      <h3>learnings</h3>
      <p>
        rather than learning new things about myself, i would more accurately describe it as a deeper learning of myself. none of the core learning was unfamiliar to me as i have grown up steeped in an introspective tradition of learning but because i work with an analytical psychologist and am always thinking in this vein, the experiences during foundations have given me more to work with in terms of my own self and the origins/ habits of my mind.

      <h3>role of values, empathy and self awareness in programming</h3>
      <p>
        a person without self awareness can be destructive and harmful to others, regardless of intent. in all aspects of life, it is difficult to be around someone with a lack of self awareness- hence, working in a team as a programmer, one needs this quality for the success and well being of not just oneself but for everyone you are directly/indirectly associated with. 
        <br>
        empathy…that practice is debatable, i prefer compassion as empathy can be draining, especially for minorities and a contributor to burnout. compassion is more active as a practice and gives rather than takes energy, whilst retaining all of the aspects of goodness. without compassion, learning and working is contextless. our lives are built up upon the work and kindness of others and if our own actions of body speech and mind do not reflect this, we are not acting in accordance with reality. the reality of our interdependence with others. so much harm can be caused to oneself and others when a person is lacking a compassionate attitude. luckily, its entirely trainable. 
        <br>
        values seems to almost come from the presence of self awareness and compassion. if values stem from these qualities, they can work for the wellbeing of the community and the person. without these qualities to guide our work and learning, we can create and engage in practices and develop tools that can cause great harm or reproduce hidden biases in our own minds that we then regurgitate out into the world out of our own places of privilege and ignorance. it seems purposeless to live in this way. the more awake we are about ourselves and the world, the more we can engage in a constructive way the serves others and therefore also ourselves. 
        <br>
        the best examples of this in the programming world are the reproduction of racism and sexism through algorithmic bias (read ‘Artificial unintelligence’ by Meredith Broussard, watch ‘Coded Bias’ documentary, follow ‘algorithmic justice league’ on instagram). without self awareness and compassion, we might very well enter the work force only to contribute unknowingly to the invisible oppression and suffering of others.

      <h3>why is the core important at EDA</h3>
      <p>
        i think it’s vital for any institution of education to act and educate responsibly the individuals who go through them. our society is made up of the collective learning we do and if there are vital parts of learning not present, this has negative effects on society. churning out technical experts with no self awareness, compassion or values is a terrifying reality, and its consequences on the world and for others is very real. if we want to reduce harm and increase benefit for the individual all the way out to society, these skills and practices are non negotiable.
