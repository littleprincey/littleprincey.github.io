            <h2>how my culture has influenced my values and identity</h2>
            <p>being raised in the tradition of tibetan buddhism amongst the tibetan diaspora of auckland, i was introduced very early on to some core values, principles and methods of understanding/ transformation. i was taught from young to analyse and not to accept things until i had rigorously tested them, as children we were introduced to the practice of non violence, meditation, contemplation and wisdom. there are an enormous amount of methods in this tradition for changing one's mind. thinking of your mind as malleable i have come to understand is not such a common understanding in our western culture. this has taught me how to work with my mind, to never give up, to not accept anything as a given, especially habits or tendencies within my own mind that might bring about harm for myself and others. the methods of introspection and compassion have also opened me up to reflecting deeply on my values and where they come from, which has thankfully led me down the path of activism, decolonialism, anti racism and other systemically influenced forms of oppression that exist in my mind and might act out unconsciously or consciously on others. it has helped me to be more open to ways of undoing prejudices and all the self work needed to be a better human being (this of course means i am aware of this influence, though speaks nothing to the degree yet which I've managed to so these things, which is not very much! its a constant process). so regardless of my ability to embody these qualities, i was exposed to the tradition of the cultivation of immense compassion, equanimity, open mindedness and wisdom and through study, analysis and contemplation i am able to embrace these as my values and commit myself to the practice of them.</p>

            <h2>strengths + limitations related to learning, career development, obstacles</h2>
            <p>i can have a strong sense of how things should be and making something better (for people/society) which can cause me to be idealistic and burnout. it can also distract me from staying on task and focussing on what may feel boring or meaningless at times. however, due to my self reflection, resilience and openness to change, i have been practicing containing myself and my at times, wild passions, to focus in and stay with something. that is what this course represents to me and because i have access to a lot of inner determination and energy, i am confident and know that i will be able to work with all the inner and outer obstacles that may arise. im lucky to have been doing this type of psychological work for a long time and so am relatively familiar with the functionings of my many current limitations! i will hone my focus, which has wayward tendencies and apply it to my studies so that i will be able to graduate, secure and job and hopefully contribute my efforts to the tech world and my own personal security to my friends and family.

            <h2>working with others</h2>
            <p>at the international university i went to in sweden, most of the work had to be done in groups so i gained a lot of experience/ exposure to working with lots of different kinds of people and the most important factor of course was always communication. i think an awareness of power dynamics is also essential as i found a lot of tension and conflict to derive in their most subtle form from this, often invisible perpetrator. at that time i was less aware of such dynamics than i am now and so it has been increasingly easier to navigate them, with that awareness. i also learnt that whilst i am on the more comfortable end of confrontation, there are many people who are not and it is very important to be sensitive and respectful of that style of conflict resolution. </p>
