            <h2>how my culture has influenced my values and identity</h2>
            <p>being raised in the tradition of tibetan buddhism amongst the tibetan diaspora of auckland, i was introduced very early on to some core values, principles and methods of understanding/ transformation. i was taught from young to analyse and not to accept things until i had rigorously tested them, as children we were introduced to the practice of non violence, meditation, contemplation and wisdom. there are an enormous amount of methods in this tradition for changing one's mind. thinking of your mind as malleable i have come to understand is not such a common understanding in our western culture. this has taught me how to work with my mind, to never give up, to not accept anything as a given, especially habits or tendencies within my own mind that might bring about harm for myself and others. the methods of introspection and compassion have also opened me up to reflecting deeply on my values and where they come from, which has thankfully led me down the path of activism, decolonialism, anti racism and other systemically influenced forms of oppression that exist in my mind and might act out unconsciously or consciously on others. it has helped me to be more open to ways of undoing prejudices and all the self work needed to be a better human being (this of course means i am aware of this influence, though speaks nothing to the degree yet which I've managed to so these things, which is not very much! its a constant process). so regardless of my ability to embody these qualities, i was exposed to the tradition of the cultivation of immense compassion, equanimity, open mindedness and wisdom and through study, analysis and contemplation i am able to embrace these as my values and commit myself to the practice of them.</p>
