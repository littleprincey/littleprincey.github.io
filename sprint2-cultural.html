        <h2>career pathway? goals</h2>
        <p>i’ve never thought of my ambitions/goals in terms of a career before so i have no idea what that might look like yet. as for a long term goal, i want to start working, pay off my student loan and get into a position where i am able to support and be generous to others the way they have to me. this would be a great joy. ultimately i want to save enough money to invest in land and start a lady village. in the meantime, i would love to work somewhere that was creating tangible benefit for the community, i’d struggle working an ‘ordinary’ job, helping people to buy things they don’t need more efficiently online, though one must do what one must do.</p>

        <h2>human skills from the EDA experience</h2>

        <p>discipline and time management! for sure! containing my self and ambitions to one area and moving through it, seeing it through and being of benefit to others on that basis is something i am very much looking forward to experiencing more and more. because by developing this skill, i can apply that to so many of my other ideas and ambitions.</p>

        <h2>strengthly strengths and limitless limitations</h2>
        
        <p>i’m good at picking things apart, and choosing when to be genuinely enthusiastic and when to challenge something. i generally adapt well to change and unexpected shifts. i don’t tend to dwell on change, but adapt and move on, even if the circumstances are getting worse, i won't dwell on when things were better which is also part of my resilience.</p> 

        <p>This can mean I'm quick to move on and not reflect on my experience as deeply as I would like to and to put up with more suffering than might be necessary.
        it is very easy to intellectualise things, in terms of capacity, in terms of time, in terms of energy and emotions. a limitation i have is not setting boundaries for my time and energy. i can intellectualise a task without considering my body and mind and end up overextending myself/burning out.</p>

		<h2>methods of getting through</h2>
    

        <p>In order to sustain the rest of this program, i know that sleep, good food, meditation and exercise are my pillars for holding up the long hours of focussed concentration, learning and collaboration. i am committed to taking care of myself in order to be a good team member, a happy member of campus and eventually a graduate!</p>
    </div>

    <div>
		<h2>seeking help</h2>
    </div>

        <p>if i’m feeling overwhelmed or concerned about the workload/ my capacity, a conversation with a another team member or a facilitator can act as a tonic of relief, to share, get perspective and renewed energy to tackle something again, try another tactic or to implement s coping strategy. and of course, never leaving this to the last minute, when it’s possibly too late.</p> 

    <div>
        <h2>facilitation team</h2>

        <p>within reason the facilitation team is there as a sort of buddy to check in on us as we waddle along down the programming path. i’m sure if i get very stuck on something that my fellow students can’t solve or that i feel uncomfortable about sharing with them that the facilitator will do what they can to help and to listen.</p>
