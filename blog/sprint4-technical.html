        <h2>im asked to tell a story about when i got blocked on a simple problem and when i solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>

        <div>
            <p>
                well first, none of the problems seem simple and i’ve yet to solve anything elegantly so the question feels like a trick…the challenges seem simple but for a brain trained in more contemplative sciences, functions are a foreign functioning to me and my poor, tired brain. though it is a good brain and i have faith she will adapt. 

                like, write a function that takes an array of strings and capitalises the first letter of each word. all good. i laugh with contempt and plough forth to conquer the problem. only to discover its hellishly foreign and takes a whole load of steps i haven’t familiarised my brain with yet and i wind up in a defeated puddle on the floor within minutes. no, not minutes perhaps, maybe an hour. 

                i searched the far reaches of tech chatrooms and found them also still unfamiliar and their explanations often raised more questions than providing answers. in the absence of a rubber ducky, my poor dog has been subjected to much meanderings and enraged attempts at explaining what the code is for. friends have witnessed my wrath of functions. shockingly, none of this has actually culminated in an elegant solution, however learning has occurred and i am incrementally  bending my mind around this new universe that is coding. 

                the most important thing i see so far is to have patience. my brain is a beautiful thing that i’m grateful for and will do all of the things if i am kind and spacious with her. the big, meaty walnut will deliver, have faith!

            <h2>problem solving techniques</h2>
            
        <div>
            <h3>psuedocode</h3>
            <p>
                this helped when i used it eventually because taking a problem all at once can be overwhelming and daunting. using pseudocode, a problem can be broken down into parts that can serve as an informal framework and reminder of what parts the challenge consists of and what needs to happen. its kind of like friendly reminders from yourself to yourself. like journaling. 
            </p>
            <h3>try something</h3>
            <p>
                close to no confidence in this yet, to just try something as it still feels like early days and my familiarity with functions is still so embryonic, there’s a lot between me now and me trying stuff…it feels like anyway. 
            </p>
            <h3>rubber ducky method</h3>
            <p>
                this is fun. super fun, and can be applied to many situations i feel. ye old rubber ducky. it’s a method of problem solving in the tech world where you explain your code to a violently yellow rubber bath toy and through this magical method, all your problems are solved! well, not quite but taking this ducky through your code, painstakingly and explaining it to them as though they don’t know what’s going on can help you to identify the bug in your code and fix a problem you’ve been having and struggling to identify the source of. this can be done with a pet or a fluffy bear or any other manner of patient/inanimate being. it forces you to clarify and externalise your process and logic, to make sense of it to something outside of yourself which can show up some problems you’ve been having. the rubber ducky method also saves some poor soul like your human friend from having to hear your awkward first attempts at communicating to the lay what you’re trying to do. 
            </p>
            <h3>reading error messages</h3>
            <p>
                these are great (apart from occasionally causing anxiety when they get all dramatic and use words like FATAL all in red) in that, if read carefully and with the right knows, can give you hints as to where you went wrong. it can even point to the line in your code where the error has been made. 
            </p>
            <h3>console logging</h3>
            <p>
                this can throw errors that you can then read into and change the code accordingly or it can execute your code and the result may be different to your intent in which case its a great way to check out if its executing right. i have yet to become dear friends with the console log…only because i’m a JavaScript baby and we haven’t yet had time to bond.
            </p>
            <h3>googling</h3>
            <p>
                this is not as easy as it sounds…for me anyway. there a certain way to google to get the answer you need, rather than a host of unrelated content in which you find yourself wading, some 20mins later. however when done right and as i hone the skill, its a rich source of online material, as almost every problem i’m sure to face has already been faced and solved by someone else who has kindly shared their learning online, where i can then harvest their brain for answers.

            </p>
            <h3>asking peers</h3>
            <p>
                this can be so great, especially because many people are willing to help and have beautiful brains that work differently and so can help to see or solve a problem/solution in another way. as a woman it can also lead to some serious mansplaining which is always a risk, sadly.
            </p>
            <h3>asking coach</h3>
            <p>
                when you get super stuck and nothing above helps and you feel like there’s no hope for you and your brain that just does not bend in those shapes, its a blessing to have the coaches. i get worried about bothering them to much as this situation arises for me quite a lot but its a wonderful backup when all else fails.
            </p>
            <h3>reflection</h3>
            <p>
                making time for reflection is a dicipline, one i have far from mastered. an incredibly useful dicipline at that. running over learnt information cements it in the brain and makes it easier available to recall. it can also give your learning greater context when its held in less detail and in a broader sense. it also helps me to feel more confident, to be able to see my progress over time, when it can feel in moments like there is none. so it can be encouraging to reflect as well.
