      <h2>what are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h2>
      <h3>
          relative, absolute, fixed! very cool words, in philosophy, but what do they mean when we are building a website using HTML?
      </h3>
      <div><p>
        when you’re being cool and making a website, using html, there will be times when you want to arrange certain aspects of your page (like an image) in a specific way. 
        there is a default ‘flow’ or layout in html where the elements will display in a sort of linear, top to bottom way according to the html code. if you want to change this flow, you will use the position property in css 

      </p>
      <p>lets say you want this image of your best friend cow, to position on the top right hand corner of the screen. without position property, it will just display in the logical order of your code and best friend cow will be lost to the flow…</p>
      <p>there are different types of positioning, depending on what you want to do with your best friend cow. we will be looking at the differences between three types> relative, absolute, and fixed positioning. 

        html default positioning is static, which is the flow described above and what we see when we run pure html with no css positioning!</p></div>
        <div><h3>relative positioning</h3></div>

        <p>relative to what?? relative to the default, static position of the element.
            img {
            positioning: relative;
            left: 30px;
            }
            this means, the image (of our best friend cow) will be pushed 30px from the left of its original (static) position. so this is why its called ‘relative’ positioning. relative to its static position, you can manipulate/stipulate its new position.</p>
