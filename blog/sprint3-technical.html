            <h2>what is HTML and CSS</h2>
            <p>
                html is the structure. css is the pretty. like if i try to bake a cake, it comes out all smelly and yum (in my case uncooked and slightly acidic) but looks pretty plain. then because its not my area of expertise, my lovely friend Sophia comes along and makes it look edible with sexy frosting and some cool design, like a star wars cake (because this cake is obviously for me). html is the structure, the unsexy cake that one looks at and could possibly say no to, but the css comes along and is the the beautifier, it does the stylising that means you cant not have a piece of my star wars cake. except your’e not allowed cos its all mine.

            <h2>what are control flow and loops </h2>
            <p>
              you’ve opted to take a ride on some awful rollercoaster at your cousin’s birthday party at disney land. you board after waiting in a long, sweaty line and the carriage takes off along the tracks. yes its awful, yes there is screaming and terror and all the jolly things but that carriage is on those tracks and set to go in only one direction, on a predetermined path and you will inevitably face the dreaded corkscrew. this is like control flow in code. the computer executes the code in a systematic way, like a carriage on tracks, until it is done. the path travelled is determined by the tracks which have already been built and thats the only way to go. you cant eject from the seat or suddenly switch to the teacups way half way through. 
              
              but say you’re one of those interesting people that loves being terrified and feeling nauseous. say you want to keep going and not just do the one, meagre circuit of pain and terror. a loop in coding allows code to repeat until a specific condition is met, interrupting the control flow. so we could write a piece of code that says- while(youLovePain === true && youWantToStop === false) {rideOn();} . this is a loop that, due to the syntax, the code will execute over and over until one or both of these conditions is not met. so you can just go and go and go on that sick ride. thanks to loops.

            <h2>the DOM</h2>
            <p>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.

                document object model. the DOM. document is usually referring to the html document - the files where all the code is stored. object is anything that is inside of these documents. model refers to how the structure is laid out. 
                so in this way it defines the logical structuring of your code and the way it is accessed and changed. this logical structuring is much like a tree <insert image>
                
                the DOM is used to interact with web pages. through the DOM a programmer can access the html (the cake) and all the other bits and bobs where that code can be manipulated, created, changed or deleted.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>accessing data from arrays and objects</h2>
            <p> an array is a list of elements, set out with the syntax shown below. arrays are indexed which means the computer gives them an order from 0 onwards which allows us to get certain elements of an array. for example, if we wanted to say that the school of Tibetan Buddhism we had studied in was gelugpa, we might write console.log(“I studied in the “ tbSchools[1] “ tradition.”) which would print- I studied in the Gelugpa tradition, as the “Gelugpa” element is indexed at 1, as computers start counting from 0. 
                
                an object however, stores data that is accessed, not through indexing, as in an array, but through what is known as properties. in the below example you can see that stored within the variable ‘profile’, there are values stored under different categories such as ‘name’, ‘sexuality’ etc. these are called properties and it is through these properties that we can access the elements contained within them. each property contains a key:value pair with which you access the data. so if we wanted to know if the orlando is angry, we might go- var orlandoIsMad = profile.isangry; - and if we printed this is would say true, according to the value in the profile. yes, orlando is mad. but not at you my dear, at the world.</p>

            <h2>functions</h2>
            <p>functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. parameters can be passed through the function that it can check data against and perform certain actions based on those parameters and data, returning a result. it means that instead of writing something over and over and over again, we can write a function that will write this thing a certain amount of times or until a specific condition is met. 
                
                functions can be ‘called’ and then their programmed function will execute with whatever inputs the programmer has defined, and presents the output. they are an essential tool to writing eloquent, condensed code that can perform complex tasks in less code.
