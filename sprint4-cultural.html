            <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
            <p>
                
                we live in a world where we are molded from birth, unconsciously by our parents and society based on factors of gender, race
                and culture. thus far, there is far more holding in place these jurassic notions of what a human being should be and how they should act depending on if they have a specific genitalia, skin colour, socio economic circumstance etc. this shapes our brain until the point where these unconscious beliefs about gender and status feel very real, like we are them and they are us and are immutable. there are many ways to break down these rigid belief systems. one, especially in western culture, is through the euro-centric scientific tradition. though it contains many of its own biases (primarily racial and patriarchal), the relatively new understanding of neuroplasticity can help us debunk hard theories of archaic beliefs that oppress us. the brain is like a muscle that can be trained. if you do a specific movement every day, your body becomes an expert in that movement, it adapts to it. the architecture of your muscles shape to accommodate that movement you are habituating it to. the same goes for your mind. anger can be a habit. habits can be changed. so too is compassion and love, complacency and indifference. the more you practice, the better you get at it. so if we truly understand the implications of this, which are enormous, it may lead us to become less superstitious about our lives. that this thing we call fate is really just us following unconscious habits that shape our lives.

            <h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h3>
            <p>
                approaching your mind as a trainable, mouldable phenomenon means that nothing is fixed. it means that any habits or tendencies i have that are harmful to myself and others are not immutable parts of who i am intrinsically. i find this beneficial in that it means my mind and my responses to the world are my own responsibility and a reflection of whatever care i do or do not take with it. like a garden, the mind needs weeding and constant upkeep. we can plant anything in the soil, with the right care and conditions. i find this helps me to be more adaptable, alert and as i said above; responsible.
            </p>
            <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
            <p>
                the big cheese in neuroplasticity is EXERCISE. you cant get past exercise. tis the tonic for so many ills. this is one of the few things that scientists agree on in terms of physical and mental wellbeing. exercise, sleep and analytical psychology all helped me recover from a massive burnout and ptsd where my brain went from firing beautifully in every way, to not being able to read, remember or even understand what someone was saying. i kept myself to a child like rhythm of healthy eating, low stress environment, enormous amounts of sleep, meditation and rigorous, daily exercise. compared to times when i was unable to do do these things, my brain would regain functioning relatively quickly. whenever im unable to sleep properly, exercise, meditate, or eat well, i can notice this in my cognitive performance. my experience is reflected in the experience of many others and in the general field of neuroscience that our wonderful bodies are impermanent and subject to change, depending on the inputs/ environment. not to mention that many other indigenous and eastern sciences have reached these truths and understandings long before western science.

            <h2>growth mindset</h2>
            <h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h3>
            <p>
                growth mindset is the belief that success in terms of abilities and learning is something developed through hard work and perseverance, as opposed to something being something a person innately has or does not have, which is the fixed mindset. the latter mindset would mean if you weren’t naturally inclined to mathematics, you might just think that you weren’t any good and couldnt make any significant gains in that area. being gendered from birth can affect this and create a fixed, gendered mindset. for instance where men can just conveniently believe they dont have the same capacities for emotional labour and child rearing as women do, and are naturally more inclined to more focused, scientific work. a growth mindset would have us see our minds in a very different way. a more open way. it would see us as more of a full spectrum human, open to possibilities and potentialities which would also mean we might place less blame externally, once we have the conditions to see our mindsets as a product of our environments and then take all the possibilities we have to work to change it.

            <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
            <p>
                it made me reflect on my existing mindset and its history, about how the culture of my family approached learning as i was growing up and how that has affected my sense of confidence and belief in relation to learning. i had analysed all of this previously but it was interesting to analyse it against the framework of the growth mindset specifically. none of it was particularly surprising, more a reflection of typical societal gendered biases and bigotries. its interesting to know to which degree learning was driven by fear  as opposed to curiosity. this shapes the brain in specific way, and thus all such future interactions with newness and learning. thank goodness for the malleable, trainable mind!  
            </p>
            <h3>how will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
            <p>
                i find it psychologically interesting to take a mental role play to coach myself through learning difficulties. like playing the role of a kind, supportive teacher (like Miss Honey from Matilda), who loves me and wants to see me succeed and believes in my innate ability to learn and grow. she wouldn’t be disheartened by any obstacles i faced, she would be perpetually optimistic about my basic capacities and would be encouraging of my ability to grow. Miss Honey can now be a character in my mental village who can help me get through dev academy and all future learnings.
